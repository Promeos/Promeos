### Hi there 👋


- 📖 I'm currently studying Data Science at [Codeup](https://codeup.com/).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [PyTorch](https://github.com/Promeos/pytorch-intro) fundamentals. 
- ⚙️ I use daily: `Python`, `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `sklearn`
- 🤔 I’m looking for sources to deliberately practice statisitics to be a better data science practioner.
