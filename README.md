### Hi there 👋


- 📖 I'm currently studying Data Science at [Codeup](https://codeup.com/)
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a [Regression Project](https://github.com/Robust-Analytics/zillow-project) to predict the market value of single family homes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [Regression](https://github.com/Promeos/regression-exercises) Models using `sklearn`, and [PyTorch](https://github.com/Promeos/pytorch-intro) fundamentals. 
- ⚙️ I use daily: `Python`, `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `sklearn`
- 👯 I’m collaborating with [Anthony Straine](https://github.com/datastraine) on the zillow-project ^.
- 🤔 I’m looking for sources to deliberately practice statisitics to be a better data science practioner.
