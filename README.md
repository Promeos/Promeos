### Hi there 👋

My name is Chris. I seek to improve the quality of peoples lives by gleaning actionable insights from data. Business questions that boil down to: "How can I earn more revenue from a customer?" bore me. If the question/purpose is focused on the betterment of the people, you have my attention.
