### Hi there 👋

My name is Chris. I want to improve the quality of peoples lives by gleaning actionable insights from data. Business questions that boil down to: "How can I earn more revenue from a customer?" or "How can I predict x (that negatively impacts the customer)?" bore me and lack ethical reasoning. If the question/purpose is focused on the people, you have my attention.


- 📖 I'm currently studying Data Science at [Codeup](https://codeup.com/).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [PyTorch](https://github.com/Promeos/pytorch-intro) fundamentals. 
- ⚙️ I use daily: `Python`, `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `sklearn`
- 📙 I'm currently reading [Think Stats](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/) and [Practical Statistics](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Statistics-Data-Scientists-Essential/dp/1491952962).
